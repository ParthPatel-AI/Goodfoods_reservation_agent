## Long Term Goal
To build an intelligent reservation assistant bot that helps customers book tables, manage reservations, and get real-time updates seamlessly.

## Success Criteria
- Smooth and error-free booking experience
- Handles multiple customer queries simultaneously
- Provides instant confirmation and updates
- Easy integration with restaurant reservation systems
- Positive customer feedback on usability

# Use case

The Reservation Assistant Bot will act as a digital concierge for customers looking to book tables at a restaurant. Customers can interact with the bot using natural language, specify preferences such as date, time, and number of guests, and receive instant confirmations. The bot can also handle modifications or cancellations, provide menu recommendations, and share restaurant details. This enhances customer convenience while reducing the workload on staff. The bot ensures consistent, 24/7 availability, leading to higher customer satisfaction and increased reservations.

## Key Steps (Bot flow)

1. Customer initiates chat (e.g., “I want to book a table”).
2. Bot asks for booking details (date, time, number of guests).
3. Customer provides input.
4. Bot checks availability in the reservation system.
5. Bot confirms booking or offers alternatives.
6. Customer receives confirmation message.
7. Optionally, bot provides menu links or special offers.
