# GoodFoods Conversational Reservation System — Use Case & Business Strategy

## 1) Executive Summary
GoodFoods operates a fast-growing multi-location restaurant brand. The current reservation workflow (calls, manual logs, fragmented web forms) limits table utilization and guest experience. We propose a conversational AI Reservation Agent that handles discovery, recommendations, bookings, changes, and cancellations across 80+ outlets. The agent integrates with a catalog (locations, capacity, attributes), supports intent-driven tool-calling, and plugs into CRM for marketing.

**Business Outcomes**
- Increase table utilization and reduce no-shows
- Boost average order value via contextual upsell (e.g., chef’s menus, special events)
- Reduce call center costs and response times
- Improve NPS through fast, natural interactions

## 2) Key Problems & Non-Obvious Opportunities
- **Fragmented booking channels** → Consolidate across WhatsApp, web, IVR, and kiosks via the same agent core.
- **Static search** → Dynamic, preference-aware recommendations (dietary, ambiance, live music, special dates).
- **No-show and late cancellations** → Proactive reminders, easy rescheduling, credit-card holds during peak slots.
- **Underutilized shoulder hours** → Targeted incentives to shift demand (smart time suggestions with offers).
- **Events & private dining** → Flow for large parties and PDRs with deposits and menu pre-orders.
- **Operational insights** → Demand heatmaps, peak-time staffing guidance, forecasted covers by daypart.
- **Loyalty uplift** → Recognize VIPs, retain preferences (seating, spice tolerance), personalized follow-ups.

## 3) Success Metrics (North Star & Guardrails)
- **Conversion**: Search→Reservation conversion ≥ 28% within 90 days.
- **Utilization**: Peak-hour seat utilization +8–12%; shoulder-hour utilization +15%.
- **No-show rate**: -20% via reminders, CC holds, and easy rescheduling.
- **Response time**: P95 under 3s for tool calls, under 6s overall.
- **CSAT/NPS**: +10 NPS improvement for reservation touchpoints.
- **Operational**: ≥ 95% booking accuracy (time/date/party/venue).

## 4) ROI Model (Illustrative)
Assume 80 locations, avg 110 seats, 2 seatings per evening, 60% baseline utilization. Adding **+10% utilization** across 300 days/year yields ~1.76M additional covers. At ₹600 net contribution per cover → **₹105 Cr incremental** annual contribution. Subtract agent + infra + integration (~₹2 Cr/yr) → **~₹103 Cr net**. Even with conservative assumptions (+4% utilization) ROI remains >20x.

## 5) Stakeholders & RASCI
- **R**: Product Manager (Reservations), AI Engineer, Backend Engineer, Data Analyst.
- **A**: Director of Growth / COO.
- **S**: City GMs, Restaurant Managers, CRM Lead, Customer Support.
- **C**: Legal (data/privacy), Finance (payments/holds), Brand/Marketing.
- **I**: Guests, Waitstaff, Kitchen, Facilities.

## 6) Implementation Plan & Timeline (8 weeks)
- **Week 1–2**: Discovery, catalog cleanup, policies (holds, cancels), SLA design. POC agent with WhatsApp + web.
- **Week 3–4**: Live pilot in 5 outlets; integrate reminders; add large-party/PDR flow; dashboard MVP.
- **Week 5–6**: CRM + loyalty integration; offer engine; A/B tests for time-shift incentives.
- **Week 7–8**: Hardening, observability, RBAC, playbooks; rollout by city; training & SOPs.

## 7) Competitive Advantages (2–3 Differentiators)
1. **Intent-first tool-calling** (no brittle regex). Adaptable to new flows (PDR, events, pre-orders) without rewrite.
2. **Yield-aware booking**: Utilization guardrails + incentive suggestions to shift demand while protecting guest experience.
3. **Omnichannel with one core**: Same agent brain powers WhatsApp, web, IVR, kiosks; consistent data + analytics.

## 8) Vertical Expansion
- **Other chains**: Quick-service (slot pickup), cafés (table/meeting spaces), cloud kitchens (time windows).
- **Adjacent industries**: Salons/spas, coworking space bookings, sports courts, clinic appointments—same primitives (slots, capacity, holds, reminders).
- **B2B SaaS**: Offer the reservation core as an API-first platform with white-label widgets and analytics.

## 9) Risks & Mitigations
- **Hallucinations** → Strict tool responses + confirmations before booking; traceable audit logs.
- **Policy complexity** → Policy engine with templates (per-location variations).
- **Data quality** → Catalog governance: owner, SLOs, anomaly alerts.
- **Peak traffic** → Rate limits, backpressure, circuit breakers; async queues for notifications.

## 10) Future Enhancements
- Real-time seat maps; table graph allocation; waitlist + overbooking controls.
- Payments: deposits/holds, advance orders for events.
- Personalization: embeddings for preferences; re-rankers for recommendations.
- Manager console with SLA alerts; workforce suggestions by forecast.
